# Pickleball Match Predictor

A machine learning web app that predicts pickleball match outcomes based on player stats and match conditions.

## What it does

This app uses a trained logistic regression model to predict who will win a pickleball match. You select two players, set the match conditions (court type, weather, duration), and get a prediction with confidence score.

The model was trained on approximately 2,000 matches and considers:
- Player rankings and win rates
- Court type (indoor vs outdoor)
- Weather conditions  
- Expected match duration

## Running locally

You'll need Python 3.12+ installed.

### With uv (strongly recommended, I'm begging you to try it. It's life changing T_T)

Seriously, if you haven't tried [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) yet, you're missing out. It's absurdly fast and will change how you think about Python package management.


```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it (It's okay to install it on your base Python installation, trust me....)
pip install uv

# Option 1: Run directly (handles everything automatically)
uv sync
uv run app.py

# Option 2: Traditional approach
uv sync
python app.py
```


### With pip (if you must)


```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Unix/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (Command Prompt):
# .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows (PowerShell):
# .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies (much slower)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server
python app.py
```

## API endpoints

The backend provides a REST API:

- `GET /` - Web interface
- `POST /predict/players` - Get match prediction
- `GET /players` - List all players
- `GET /players/{id}` - Get player details
- `GET /health` - Health check

Full API docs available at `/docs` when running.

## Model performance

The logistic regression model achieves ~85% accuracy on the test set, which is solid performance for this type of sports prediction task.

## Dataset

The training dataset (`data/pickleball_matches.csv`) contains approximately 2,000 pickleball matches with the following features:

**Player Features:**
- Player rankings (p1_rank, p2_rank)
- Historical win rates (p1_win_rate, p2_win_rate)
- Player IDs for tracking individual performance

**Match Conditions:**
- Court type: Indoor vs Outdoor
- Weather conditions: Sunny, Cloudy, Windy, or N/A (for indoor)
- Expected match duration in minutes
- Match outcome (winner: Player 1 or Player 2)

**Feature Engineering:**
- Rank difference (p1_rank - p2_rank)
- Win rate difference (p1_win_rate - p2_win_rate)
- Categorical encoding for court type and weather
- Match duration normalization

The dataset is synthetic data generated in `notebooks/pickleball_dataset.ipynb` to simulate realistic match scenarios with varied player skill levels and conditions.

## Model Training

The machine learning pipeline is implemented in `notebooks/model_building.ipynb` and follows these steps:

**1. Data Preprocessing:**
- Handle missing values (some players lack complete historical data)
- Encode categorical variables (court_type, weather)
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Train/validation/test split (70/15/15)

**2. Model Selection:**
- Tested multiple algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Logistic Regression performed best with cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

**3. Feature Importance:**
- Player rank difference: Most predictive feature
- Win rate difference: Second most important
- Court type: Moderate impact (some players prefer indoor/outdoor)
- Weather conditions: Minor but measurable effect

**4. Model Evaluation:**

```
Accuracy: 85.2%
Precision: 0.87 (Player 1), 0.83 (Player 2)  
Recall: 0.84 (Player 1), 0.86 (Player 2)
F1-Score: 0.85 (Player 1), 0.84 (Player 2)
```


**5. Model Persistence:**
The trained model is saved as `data/pickleball_model.joblib` for fast loading in production.

**Reproducing Results:**

```bash
# Generate new synthetic dataset (optional)
jupyter notebook notebooks/pickleball_dataset.ipynb

# Train the model from scratch
jupyter notebook notebooks/model_building.ipynb
```


## Deployment


### Other platforms
The app should work on most Python hosting platforms (Railway, Render, etc.) since it's just a standard FastAPI app with minimal dependencies.

## Technical details

**Backend**: FastAPI with scikit-learn for ML inference  
**Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
**Model**: Logistic regression trained with scikit-learn  
**Data**: CSV files, model stored as joblib pickle  

## Future improvements

- More training data would definitely help accuracy
- Could add more sophisticated features (head-to-head records, recent form, etc.)
- Real-time match tracking would be cool
- Mobile-responsive design needs work


## Live Demo

ðŸŽ¾ **Try the app live:** [https://huggingface.co/spaces/HafizRein/pickleball-match-predictor](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HafizRein/pickleball-match-predictor)

The demo is fully functional - select two players, adjust match conditions, and get real-time predictions!

## Architecture

Pretty straightforward setup - the frontend calls the FastAPI backend, which loads the trained model and returns predictions. Player data and match history are stored in CSV files for simplicity.

## Reflection

Building this was honestly pretty fun! I got to play around with the full ML pipeline - from generating fake (but realistic) data to deploying a working app that people can actually use. The trickiest part was probably getting the synthetic data to feel believable without being too predictable.

If I were building this for actual pickleball tournaments, I'd definitely want real match data first (obviously). The synthetic approach worked great for learning, but nothing beats the messiness of real-world data. I'd also love to add stuff like recent player form, head-to-head records, maybe even court surface preferences - there's so much that goes into sports predictions beyond just rankings.

The architecture is pretty simple right now, which I like. FastAPI makes it super easy to add new features, and the whole thing could scale up nicely if you wanted to integrate with live tournament feeds or build analytics dashboards for coaches. Plus, uv makes dependency management actually enjoyable (seriously, try it if you haven't!).
